# Parsec

I wrote this Markdown Parser initially to practice Python, and then found out I could
actually use it for other projects, so I decided to flesh it out. The goal (for now)
is to implement the "Basic Syntax" according to markdownguide.org, and to follow the
best practice described there.

In the short term, I will focus on:  
    - [ ] headings
    - [ ] text styles
    - [ ] paragraphs
    - [ ] lists
